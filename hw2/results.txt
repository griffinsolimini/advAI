As the number of means increases from k = 2 up until k = 12, the mean of the error steadily
decreases for each new mean added to the clustering. The error stabilizes once the number 
of means reaches around k = 12 or k = 15. The standard deviation increases from k = 2 to 
k = 5, and then decreases until k = 15, where it stabilizes. This shows that increasing the 
number of means increases your accuracy of classification, but only to a certain threshold, 
at which point the extra computation time required to compute k-means with additional means 
is not worth the difference in classification error.
